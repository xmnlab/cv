\CLSubject{Application: Scientific Software Engineer (Contract)}

Dear Hiring Committee,

I'm applying for the Scientific Software Engineer contractor role. I'm excited by
Neuromatch's mission of advancing open, accessible training and open-source
scientific tooling, and by the chance to support a multi-institution effort
building interoperable Python tools for computational behavioral analysis and
physics-based simulation.

I combine research software engineering with strong delivery habits: building and
maintaining Python libraries, improving test coverage, packaging, CI/CD,
documentation, and reproducible environments. I enjoy the full loop of
open-source work---triaging issues, refactoring for clarity and performance, and
shipping reliable integrations across multiple repositories.

While I haven't specialized in physics-based simulation, I learn quickly and
have applied signal processing in engineering contexts, including weigh-in-motion
systems for heavy vehicles and viscoelastic pavement analysis using laboratory
experiment data. That experience helped me become comfortable with
measurement-driven workflows, numerical data pipelines, validation, and careful
interpretation of results---skills that translate well to scientific computing.

This role also matches my background building and operating backend/data
platforms (Python, Django, REST APIs, Celery, Docker, PostgreSQL/Elasticsearch)
and creating developer-facing tools that reduce friction for researchers,
including notebook- and web-based workflows.

I work comfortably in distributed teams: I lead code reviews, coordinate across
stakeholders, and mentor contributors through open-source projects and training
programs. I'm available for a part-time engagement (8--16 hours/week) and can
overlap with U.S. business hours.

\CLSignoff{Sincerely}{Ivan Ogasawara}{}
